Paste into web browser to delete items from the trash bin in protonmail
Due to waiting for api response for the next 50 emails after deletion, there is a wait and this can take some time.
Script will error out once done, this is fine.

Why does protonmail not have a mass delete feature that reaches past its 50 loaded messages limit?
